"""
Write a Python program named sentences.py that generates simple English sentences. 
During this prove milestone, you will write functions that generate sentences with three parts:

a determiner (sometimes known as an article)
a noun
a verb
For example:

A cat laughed.
One man eats.
The woman will think.
Some girls thought.
Many dogs run.
Many men will write.
For this milestone, your program must include at least these five functions:

main
make_sentence
get_determiner
get_noun
get_verb
You may add other functions if you want. The functions get_determiner, get_noun, 
and get_verb, must randomly choose a word from a list of words and return the 
randomly chosen word. All the functions that you must write for this milestone 
assignment are described in the Steps section below.

Use the get_determiner function from the previous lessonâ€™s prove milestone as an example to help you write the get_preposition function. The get_preposition function must have the following header and fulfill the requirements of the following documentation string.
def get_preposition():
    Return a randomly chosen preposition
    from this list of prepositions:
        "about", "above", "across", "after", "along",
        "around", "at", "before", "behind", "below",
        "beyond", "by", "despite", "except", "for",
        "from", "in", "into", "near", "of",
        "off", "on", "onto", "out", "over",
        "past", "to", "under", "with", "without"

    Return: a randomly chosen preposition.
    
Write the get_prepositional_phrase function to have the following header and fulfill the requirements of the following documentation string.
def get_prepositional_phrase(quantity):
    Build and return a prepositional phrase composed
    of three words: a preposition, a determiner, and a
    noun by calling the get_preposition, get_determiner,
    and get_noun functions.

    Parameter
        quantity: an integer that determines if the
            determiner and noun in the prepositional
            phrase returned from this function should
            be single or pluaral.
    Return: a prepositional phrase.
    
Add code to the make_sentence function and write any other functions that you think are necessary for your program to generate and print six sentences, each with a determiner, a noun, a verb, and a prepositional phrase. The six sentences must have the following characteristics:

Quantity	Verb Tense
a.	single	past
b.	single	present
c.	single	future
d.	plural	past
e.	plural	present
f.	plural	future


"""

Write the main function to call your make_sentence function six times and print six sentences with these characteristics:

Quantity	Verb Tense

b.	single	present
c.	single	future
d.	plural	past
e.	plural	present
