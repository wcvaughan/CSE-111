Using VS Code, open a new file. Copy and paste all of the example program above into the new file. Save the new file as cone_volume.py
Run your cone_volume.py program. What error message do you see in the terminal frame?
Fix the cone_volume function which begins on line 37 by adding two parameters to its header. What parameter names should you use?

Hint: the parameter names at line 37 and the variable names at line 39 must be the same.
Fix the call to the cone_volume function that is in main at line 13 by adding two arguments. Because the cone_volume function has two parameters (you added the two parameters in the previous step), each call to the cone_volume function must have two arguments. What variable names should you use for the arguments?

Hint: the only variables that you can use must be defined inside main above line 13.
Fix the call to the cone_volume function that is in main at line 28 by adding two arguments. What variable names should you use for the arguments?

Hint: the only variables that you can use must be defined inside main above line 28.
Save your program and run it again. Did it run correctly? If not, fix the mistakes until it runs correctly.
