# CSE-111

# Found what seems to be a syllabus for the CSE-111 course at BYU-Idaho and decided to work ahead as it is my next course starting Jan 2024. Whether the assignments are the same as what I'll see in my own course it is very likely the same material being taught
# And if it isn't the same material I am still gaining valuable practice working in Python. Additionally, if all this work is what I will be doing then I can use this repository as proof that I did not just copy other people's work.
